  Values:
  - I don't hire anybody who's not brighter than I am. If they're not brighter than
    I am, I don't need them.
  - Exercise ferments the humors, casts them into their proper channels, throws off
    redundancies, and helps nature in those secret distributions, without which the
    body cannot subsist in its vigor, nor the soul act with cheerfulness.
  - It has been said that man is a rational animal. All my life I have been searching
    for evidence which could support this.
  - Painting is an attempt to come to terms with life. There are as many solutions
    as there are human beings.
  - Without freedom from the past, there is no freedom at all, because the mind is
    never new, fresh, innocent.
  - A great leader never sets himself above his followers except in carrying responsibilities.
  - Forget about style; worry about results.
  - It takes as much imagination to create debt as to create income.
  - If people have to choose between freedom and sandwiches, they will take sandwiches.
  - Undertake something that is difficult; it will do you good. Unless you try to
    do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.
